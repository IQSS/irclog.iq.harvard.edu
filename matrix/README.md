From May 2021 until September 2023, the Dataverse community used Matrix.

In this directory you'll find logs of those conversations.

Matrix was a good landing spot after freenode fell apart. See https://github.com/IQSS/chat.dataverse.org/issues/12

Eventually, we switched to Zulip and updated https://chat.dataverse.org to point to https://dataverse.zulipchat.com

For more on the story of switching from from Matrix to Zulip, see https://github.com/IQSS/chat.dataverse.org/issues/22
